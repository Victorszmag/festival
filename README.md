Working
This is my "festival app"
I am planning to make a festival app, based on adding, editing, and deleting sets or performances. To have name of the act, time, and stage and if you have seen them or not. For long term goals I want to see if I could add a login and sign up feature to be connected to the planner. Also want to have a tab so you could load up the map of the festival. FAQ for the fest goers and the tickets section to buy if they dont already and also a merch section. Thats my goal because it is something that I could see myself doing in the long term working for a festival. For long term goal, it would be to have this application run in offline mode, bypassing the login requirments to plan out the festival day since most festivals dont have an ideal amount of internet.

Next Steps: 
1. I wish to have add my own fake map/lineup/FAQ on a website that shows the stages
2. Make the app work offline/ with limited data due to festival enviroment
3. Have an api or some system to have basic wiki populate about the act and mark what stage on the map they are playing
4.  Would like to have a system built in to buy merch and tickets from the site/app
